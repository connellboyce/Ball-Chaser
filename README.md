- The application normally would not be active on Replit after the browser was closed, but there are exceptions.
  - Web servers will stay open on Replit after a browser is closed, but only for 1 hour after its last interaction.
  - This is solved with UptimeRobot: an application which pings the web server for the bot.
  - The web server is pinged every 5 minutes, keeping the bot online.
- These two services in conjunction allow the Ball-Chaser bot to run 24/7.
- See links to these two services in [References](#6-references)
